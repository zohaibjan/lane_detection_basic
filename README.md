# Basic lane detention using OpenCV

This program is created on my journey to learn the course "Self Driving Cars" In order to use it just type python main.py <FILENAME> <1/2> (<FILENAME> = #name of the image/video file make sure it is present in the same directory <1/2> = 1 is for image, 2 is for videos)
